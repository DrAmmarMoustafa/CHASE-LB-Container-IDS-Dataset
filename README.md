# CHASE-LB: Realistic Host-based Dataset for Containerized Environments

## üìå Overview
**CHASE-LB** is the first host-based intrusion detection dataset specifically designed for **containerized environments**.  
It was created to fill the gap left by legacy datasets such as **ADFA-LD** and **LID-DS**, which no longer reflect modern attack vectors or container-specific vulnerabilities.  

The dataset was collected by monitoring **WordPress** and **MySQL** applications running inside **Docker containers** on **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS**, with **system calls** captured using **Sysdig**.  

The main objective of CHASE-LB is to support researchers and security practitioners in building and evaluating machine learning models for intrusion detection in cloud-native infrastructures.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Recorded Behaviors

### Normal Activity
- User management  
- Content management  
- Browsing and downloading articles  
- Theme editing  
- CRUD operations  
- Database maintenance  
- Creating/dropping tables  
- Privilege management  
- Remote access  

### Attack Scenarios
Malicious traces were generated by simulating real-world exploits based on **recent CVEs**, including:  

- **SQL Injection**: CVE-2020-9483, CVE-2017-5638  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: CVE-2021-36905  
- **OS Command Injection**: CVE-2019-15107, CVE-2019-16662  
- **Path Traversal**: CVE-2020-17518, CVE-2021-26086, CVE-2021-41773  
- **Privilege Escalation & Container Escape**: CVE-2024-21626, CVE-2024-23653  
- **Authorization Bypass in Docker Engine**: CVE-2024-41110  
- **PHP Object Injection**: CVE-2020-35939

## üè∑Ô∏è Structure
Each **CSV file** includes the following fields:  

- `trace_id`, `timestamp`  
- `syscall_id`, `syscall_name`, `param_count`, `param_types`  
- `datalength`, `flag`  
- `return_value`, `success`, `error_code`  
- `label` ‚Üí `0 = normal`, `1 = attack`  
- (Future-ready fields such as `pid` and `container_id` are included for contextual modeling)  

---

## üìä Benchmarking
A hybrid model (TF-IDF + Word2Vec + LSTM + contextual features) was trained on CHASE-LB, showing significant improvements:  

- **AUC:** 0.955 vs 0.910 (LID-DS)  
- **AUC:** 0.945 vs 0.870 (ADFA-LD)  
- Up to **58% reduction** in false alarms

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
CHASE-LB can be used for:  
- Training machine learning models for host-based IDS in containerized environments  
- System call sequence analysis  
- Reducing false alarm rates in anomaly detection
